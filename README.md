## Introduction
Daksh was started in 2006 by a group of citizens concerned about the lack of accountability in politics and governance. Daksh currently consists of people from diverse backgrounds including academics, entrepreneurs, lawyers, teachers, social and political activists and ordinary citizens.
Daksh's Objective

  - Track performance of elected governments and representatives by collecting relevant information on a regular basis.
  - Collect and present detailed, query-friendly background information about people in politics.
  - Elicit and present the perceptions of citizens at a local level.
  - Present human development indicators at the most important unit of political activity- the constituency.
  - Promote active citizen participation to ensure accountability in politics and governance.

## Problem Area
During this collaboration with DataKindBLR, DAKSH wants to explore how can we use their data to **"Empower Judges with Data Driven Approach"**.

## Project Overview
We are working on various analysis and will be presenting the analysis using [Superset](https://superset.incubator.apache.org/); Superset is an open software that sits between a database and lets us create simple visualizations. The list of analysis that we are working on are represented in the [projects section](https://github.com/DataKind-BLR/Daksh-Sprint-2018/projects); each project is an analysis that is being worked on.
